# Numerical Methods
This is just some code that I'm writing to implement algorithms from my numerical computing class.
I'll start from bisection and probably end at finite element method or more... it doesn't depend on what i learn in the class

## What's next for this project
The code will be well documented and I'll turn it into a usable module over time so that I can use it for whatever purpose I need to.
Thnx, keep nerding
