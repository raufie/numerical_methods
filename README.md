# Numerical Methods
This is just some code that I'm writing to implement algorithms from my numerical computing class.
I'll start from bisection and probably end at finite element method or more... it doesn't depend on what i learn in the class but most of that stuff with other stuff(like gradient optimizations) will end up here. There are already so many other libraries for this, this is for learning so expect that. 

# Purpose
Learning

## What's next for this project
The code will be well documented and I'll turn it into a usable module over time so that I can use it for whatever purpose I need to or someone else in the community needs to... make sure to use this code with attributes : )
Thnx, keep nerding
